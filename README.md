# Hey, I'm Luke ðŸ‘‹

## About Me:

I'm a full-stack developer. I'm pathologically curious and I love to build. Currently, I'm specializing in JavaScript, Node.js, React (Next.js), and PostgreSQL. Before becoming a developer I studied Mechanical Engineering at Queen's University and spent a decade in the music industry as a producer, artist and audio engineer. If you're feeling saucy [you can have a listen here ðŸ’¿.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4musCItyvLBJYaHClwbTLd?si=NCpM9u4rQYOr48VPs6TBvA). You can reach me at [luke@lukemelnik.co](mailto:luke@lukemelnik.co). 

## What I'm Up To:

- I'm focused on learning the deeper parts of JavaScript
- I built an AI-powered spaced repetition app called [Forember](https://forember-9vyt.vercel.app/)
- [I built a personal site](https://lukemelnik.co) and I'm blogging about what I learn. It's been awesome to explore self-hosting with Coolify and it got me started with Docker.

## What I'd Like to Dive Deeper Into

- Learning Python and exploring machine learning
- Networking
- Cybersecurity

## Fun Fact
